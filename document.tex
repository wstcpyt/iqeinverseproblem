\title{Reconstruction of the charge collection probablity in a CIGS solar cell
from Internal Quantum Efficiency measurements by the regularization method}
\date{\today}
\maketitle
\abstract{A new method is introduced to analyze the Internal Quantum
Efficiency(IQE) data that are obtained on a $Cu(In,Ga)S{{e}_{2}}$(CIGS) solar
cells by irradiation
with variable wavelength. This method aims at directly reconstruction the
distribution $\phi(z)$ of the charge collection probability in the device, by
inverting the integral transform that connects $\phi(z)$ to the neasured IQE.
This inversion is generally an ill-posed problem, which, however can be solved
by the regularization method (TSVD or Tikhonov). This procedure is used to
analyze the simulated and experiment measurements IQE data on CIGS solar cells.}
